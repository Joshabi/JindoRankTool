A tool to visualise and eventually grade Beat Saber maps on their difficulty/complexity.

In its current state, this is a very hacked together work-in-progress project, it also incorporates parity checking logic from https://github.com/Joshabi/JoshaParity

This started out as an exercise in reading the Beat Saber custom map file format, long-term the aim is to generate swing data for the maps and use it to grade maps on their difficulty.
